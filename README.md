Investigations into the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on air quality in Los Angeles County

## Background
As a resident of LA County, it feels like the air quality has improved dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is a repository of my efforts to investigate that phenomenon, which if true has health implications of its own.

## Information sources
So far, all of the data I have used comes from the CARB (California Air Resources Board) Air Quality Data query tool:
https://www.arb.ca.gov/aqmis2/aqdselect.php

A folder of research papers that discuss relationships between air quality and health outcomes is also included, though not used directly at this point.
